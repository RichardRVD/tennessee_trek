# tennessee_trek
  This was my first personal project I have ever created. This is intended to be a work in progress type project that eventually my husband and I will
use for our own fun and leisure and maybe even bring some folks along with us on some hiking or kayaking tours! 

  I built this using the Python stack utilizing flask for the flexibility it offers. I also used Jinja and a MySQL database in this CRUD application
to store users when they login to the project. I implemented validations for login and registration with error messages displayed in appropriate lines 
and utilized Bcrypt for security and password hashing. On the front end HTML, CSS, and bootstrap were used to give an awesome display when a user hits 
the landing pages. This will continue to be a fun project to keep working on as the days and months come.
